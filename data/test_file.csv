I already have a loan with Lending Club that I took out in Dec 2009. It was that loan that allowed me to pay off the credit card companies. After an entire year my credit score has started to come up and I am finally seeing things get better for me. All because Lending Club gave me a loan when no one else would. It has been a huge blessing for me. <br/><br/>The reason why I am now applying for another loan is because for the past few months my car, a 2002 Honda Civic, has been giving me trouble. I can't seem to find a reliable auto repair shop that I can count on. I fear my car has become a money pit so instead of paying more than $800 in car repairs every 3 months I rather get rid of it and get a more reliable car that I don't have to worry about expensive repairs. <br/><br/>However, I can't afford another car payment with out over extending myself so when I saw the offer to lower the payments, it was the answer to my prayers. This way I can continue to pay my debt and pay on a newer car instead of paying expensive car repairs with my credit cards. Just last month, I paid more than $800 with my discover card to repair my car. I didn't want to do that, but with tax time around the corner I thought I could pay it off. Only problem is that now my car still has a leak, my heater and air conditioning are not working properly, and now it is making sounds when I turn my steering wheel. Hopefully, I won't have to put another cent into this car. <br/><br/>I have been paying my current loan on time, as I do with all my bills. <br/><br/>Again thank you in advance for taking the time to consider my loan request.<br/>",debt_consolidation,LC2,338xx,FL,20.07,1.0,Jan-1995,0.0,23.0,,13.0,0.0,9187.0,60.4%,24.0,f,0.0,0.0,14522.8274784289,14522.83,10500.0,4022.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,Aug-2014,4499.14,,Jun-2022,0.0,1.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,N,,,,,,

As business picks up, I will cut back hours at my current job.  I have talked with my boss about this and she supports my plan.<br/><br/>My background:<br/><br/>After graduating from high school, I attended college for a year and a half.  I decided to quit college and get a job.  Got a job with a school district as a computer tech for the high school.  Within two years, I became the district network administrator through hard work and teaching myself the required skills.  After 9/11, I decided to join the US Army in which I served for 5 years at Fort Drum, NY.  I received several citations for my strong work ethic and performance.  I then moved to Fairbanks, AK and started working for Morning Star Ranch, my current employer.  Within a few weeks of working there, I was put in a position of authority to direct my coworkers and handle the money in the boss's absence.  I am someone that my boss relies upon as the go-to guy.<br/><br/>The business:<br/><br/>I have been searching for a business to start up since I've been out of the military.  Cleanpro is the first business that I've come across that I felt would give me job satisfaction, a good income, and will stand out from other competitors.  The Cleanpro method of cleaning carpets is different from steam cleaning in some very important ways.  First, the solutions are all organic and citrus based and they leave no residue after drying to attract dirt.  They are safe to use around pets and people.  Second, the carpet dries in one to two hours.  The carpet isn't saturated down through the pad so there isn't a chance for mold or bacteria to grow.  Finally and most importantly is that it gets the carpet clean.  I called a few owners up in different parts of the country to ask them if the results were as good as what promotional video said.  All of the people I talked to, owners and employees, said it was better.  That they are still amazed at how clean the carpets get and how long they stay clean.<br/><br/>I fully believe that this business is going to work and I've already put $15,000 deposit down with Cleanpro USA LLC that goes toward the licensing and equipment that is needed.  This loan will fund the remaining cost of the equipment, a used delivery van, insurance, travel costs for training, and other start up costs.  <br/><br/>Please feel free to ask me any questions, and thank you for your time.<br/>",small_business,Life Improvement Loan,997xx,AK,19.86,0.0,Jan-1997,0.0,,,10.0,0.0,4175.0,17%,26.0,f,0.0,0.0,16838.4379937983,16810.37,15000.0,1838.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,Feb-2014,533.51,,Feb-2014,0.0,1.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,N,,,,,,

Status:Fully Paid,n,"I bought a 2005 convertible nissan 350Z last year because my ex boyfriend told me he'd pay for half the monthly payments. We ended up breaking up and now I pay for it myself. Thing is, I dont need a car that expensive, and I can't sell it to a private party because I make payments in it and I can't get the title until the car is paid off. You can't sell a car to a private party unless you hold the title.  I could sell to a dealer but they will pay me 6000 less than what I owe in the car so that is completely out of question. I owe $20300 in the car, a dealer would give me 14k and I can sell it to a private party for 19 or 20k.  Therefore, the purpuse of this loan is so that I can pay off my car, so I can get the title and sell it to a private party. Then I would use the sale money, whenever it sells, to buy a much cheaper car (I was thinking something like 5k) and use the rest as a down payment in a house I wanna buy.   The other option I would have to stop wasting money in this car is to have someone take over my car payments and just transfer the title to that person when the car is paid off. I find that very risky because the car would still me under my name and responsability and if the person doesnt make my payment in time it would affect my credit negatively when I am trying to buy a house.  I have never paid any bills late and I wouldn't let someone one do that with my name and credit. Not to mention the damage that can be done to the car and all things that can go wrong with that option.  I am a great candidate for this loan because I am an extremely honest and responsable person. I pay all my bills at least a week before their due date, always on time, and I always pay them until they are paid off. The only reason my credit is not even higher is because I am a foreigner and dont have enough credit history since I have only been in the States for 4 years.  I am a software enginner and I make enough money to pay this loan confortably. My monthly expense with rent and utilities is only $500.

I work for a great environmental consulting firm and love my job. I also have an undying love of motorcycles, specifically sports bikes. I would like to tell you a little about myself before I get into the details of my business.  After all, a good idea is just that without someone to grow it into a profitable business. <br/><br/>I am what some would characterize, as an &ldquo;A-Type&rdquo; person.  When I set my mind on something, it always gets done.  Whether it is delivering projects on time and budget at work or promising to pick up a friend on the side of a road on my personal time, my word is good as titanium!  Therefore, I do not give my word lightly, unless I am sure I can deliver. From my core, I know this business will be profitable, even in this recession. I feel like this is perfect timing, while we are at the bottom of the recession and slowly climbing out.  I personally know this from the amount of jobs that are being designed and constructed in my firm. If you need to know more about the person behind the business, just ask.  I will try to respond right away, but sometimes this is not possible during my working day.  I will definitely answer your questions by the end of the workday.<br/><br/>I will be opening my motorcycle repair shop in the SOMA district in San Francisco, sometime in March 2011.  This will be my model shop, since I plan to expand to the rest of the Bay Area. I have about a fourth of the equipment for the shop, i.e., tire machine, hydraulic lift, and misc tools. I have very low overhead, since I will not be buying motorcycle apparel inventory.  Sometime in the future, I will be selling motorcycle apparel from a Japanese leather company that would like to start selling in the Bay Area, again.  I have a direct contact with one of the owners and I am brokering a deal that the shop will not incur upfront cost for the first six months.<br/><br/>I will be buying used motorcycles to recondition and sell. I already have two in my garage to sell. I plan to be an authorized repair facility with major insurance carriers, i.e., AAA, State Farm, Progressive, Geico Insurance, etc.  Motorcycle insurance jobs are usually several thousand dollars to repair on average and the shop will actively seek this type of repair jobs.<br/><br/>The business will be modeled similarly to a salon-type structure, whereas the mechanic will rent out a service station and will be able to use the shop equipment for a fee. The fee for renting out the service bay will be $1500.00 a month. All service technicians working for the shop will be able to handle any job, from a simple oil change to complete engine tear-down and rebuild. They will be paid a commission split of 60/40 (60% to the shop, 40% to mechanic). The shop labor rate will be between $88-$110 per hour, depending on the mechanic&rsquo;s level of experience. <br/><br/>With over 45 years of combined motorcycle service experience. I already have three journeyman mechanics onboard for my shop and they will be able to diagnosis and repair customer&rsquo;s vehicles quickly and correctly, the first time. By hiring journeyman mechanics, this will limit the number of incorrect diagnosis that plague shops that hire cheap, inexperienced mechanics with no former shop experience or that are fresh out of tech schools. After all, repeat business is how businesses survive the long haul.  I want to build an excellent reputation for the motorcycling community. <br/><br/>There are a lot of other great details, but I can only give a short description for now.

To give you a little info about me, I the 30 year old owner of HUSH Shapewear and Accessories. I have spent the last 14 months working exhaustively on  the R&D (research and development) of my brand's products, testing, designing and developing an innovative/functional line  for a broad demographic of women (ages 18- 50) I have produced an initial line of 30 products: Slimming/Bodyshaping lingerie and garments ie: tank tops + dresses(these pieces can literally can take up to 4 sizes off of a woman) Panties with removable padding, completely backless bra's, tag and bra strap ""tamers"", carbon filtered inserts for underwear, bra stap converters and comfort straps, portable lint packs and magic erasers for deodorant or spill marks, double sided body and fashion tape, invisible panties, a secret pocket for bras etc...   HUSH will be every girls best kept secret and Hollywood Stylists brand of choice for all of their clients red carpet needs. This company is my baby. I spent 5 years in NYC (my hometown) working in the entertainment industry in both Public Relations and Publishing. I've developed strong relationships with publicists and Editors at Magazines and have amassed an enormous contact list of over 800k clients waiting for HUSH's 2009 launch. These are REAL women who are ready and waiting to buy HUSH as soon as it launches. I have also built relationships with buyers at Saks, Bloomies and Neiman Marcus, as well as boutique stores in Miami, NY and L.A. who have pre-ordered inventory. HUSH will also be sold in the international market where there is huge demand and little competition.   Additionally,  I am currently building the HUSH e-commerce website www.shopHUSH.com. I have made it a point to fund my business with personal capital and not by incurring debt and up until this point have been successful. However, the demand for these products has exceeded my initial expectations (not the worst problem to have) and I am seeking this loan to cover a small portion of my upfront manufacturing/delivery costs. My business is one of the few that is seemingly insulated from the current economic downturn. History and studies show that women tend to spend more, rather than less, on vanity and beauty items during a recession.   I work with reliable manufacturers in both Asia and Colombia, South America and can supply more information about them if wanted. The margins on my products are good, typically 4:1. I am a safe, reliable borrower with a smart business plan and innovative line of products. I have a good credit history with little debt. I hope that you will deem me a worthy borrower and thank you in advance for taking the time to read this.

Due to these high rates, and my current inability to pay more than the minimum, I have been unable to see any abatement in my credit balances. It feels like a never ending story of debt. These credit cards/lines were opened to help fund my graduate education at New School University in New York City. Since graduating in 2006, I have increased my income by $30,000, which indicates to me that my graduate education was the correct decision. I'm grateful for that opportunity and the rewards I continue to reap from my Master's degree. Yet, in my three years since graduating, I have not been able to make an impact on my debt. Recently, I suffered a miscarriage, an emotionally devastating personal moment; this occurrence, though, has inspired me to pay off my debt in the next few years so that my future children will have a debt-free, budget concious mom. Further, paying off this debt quickly will allow me to continue my education to the PhD level. My plan is to attain my PhD in literature in order to become a director of an English department. As director, I want to balance the humanities with career guidance for undergraduate and graduate English majors, a component that is currently lacking from most (if not all) English Departments. Please feel free to contact me if you need further information about my current financial situation. Thank you.

I am seeking to consolidate my debt because I paid for some graduate school expenses with my credit cards, as well as utilizing a higher interest personal loan.  Due to the current financial economy, I was not able to obtain a student loan.   I usually obtain my student loans through TERI, which is currently in reorganization and is not accepting new loans.   I go to law school part time in the evening (don't hold this against me for those of you who may not be fond of lawyers) and work full time as a senior business analyst.     I will be consolidating the personal loan, as well as some credit card debt.  The payment of this loan ($378) will be lower than what I am currently paying for these debts ($294 for the loan, $75/month for two different credit cards that I plan to pay off).   In addition, the interest rate on this loan is lower than all rates on these three items.   Thank-you for your consideration - again, I have no late payments or any other negative credit history.  My only issue is that I have high revolving debt because I paid for some education expenses using credit.    I appreciate your consideration.

My Situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because I haven't been late on my payments, and I have a stable income since I've been working for the same company for over 25 years. I would like to take advantage of the savings in interest I pay by putting all of my debt into one loan. I have two credit cards and one car loan. The remaining portion of the funds I would like to use to help my daughter. She recently graduated college and with this economy, she has had a hard time getting a job. Her loans are coming out of deferrment and since I was a single-father, I was not able to help pay for her tuition while she was attending, so I feel I could really help her now by lumping a portion of her loans into this.  Below are the balances of my debt:  1. Washington Mutual -$2,500 2. Bank of America -$1,500 3. Local Credit Union (Car Loan) -$5,600  Totals: Approximately $9,600 Remaining: $10,400 to put towards my daughter's school loans.  I feel I am a great candidate for this because, just like my dedication to my work, I am just as dedicated to my financial obligations. Being able to pay off all of this debt for me and my daughter in just 3 years really gives me a sense of hope that we can both be better off fairly soon.

It has worsened to a point that my eyes can no longer be fitted with glasses or contacs.  my only option is to have a corneal cross-linking done to stabilize the cornea, then either a lens implant or lens transplant to allow my eyes to be fitted properly.  If I do not have the procedure, then I am faced with the inconvenience of not being able to see clearly and place my career of choice for over 20 years on the line.  As a teacher, I am continuously transitioning from close vision to far away and the keratakonis keeps me from having that clarity. <br/>Unfortunately, this medical procedure is quite expensive and not covered by insurance.  Also, due to my home location, travel and lodging for re-coup time and follow up appointments almost double the cost of the operation.

I was really not looking forward to my summer because although I have the time for the surgery and healing, I lacked the funds to see it through.  I asked the specialist in Toronto why insurance does not cover it, especially since there are no other options.  He told me that insurance will cover the equipment needed to perform the procedure, but not the surgery itself.  It is so frustrating to work so hard and ensure all monthly bills are covered, only to find out that all the insurance premiums I pay do absolutely nothing  to help me when I need it.  I also have narcolepsy and cataplexy which requires medication in order to maintain the level of seratonin necessary to get through my day.  The medications needed for this condition are very expensive and there are constant stressors from insurance there as well.  I am able to cover the meds that are not covered by the deductible/copay but I am just not able to prepared myself for something of this magnitude.  I think that this is a fantastic program for lending and someday when I am in a better place financially, I will gladly become a lender to someone who is in need like I am now.  I believe strongly in a ""pay it forward"" philosophy in all aspects, even it is just passing on a smile and/or ccompliment.

Once I have them completely paid off, they are finally getting canceled and shredded immediately.   I am looking forward to the day that I'm finally debt-free.

My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.<br/><br/>To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc. <br/><br/>Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.<br/><br/>My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year. <br/><br/>Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.<br/><br/>Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).<br/><br/>One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances). <br/><br/>I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough.<br/> Borrower added on 07/09/10 > I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed.

If funded, this loan will pay off my 2 credit cards that carry balances and allow me to divert funds to pay this loan at a much lower interest rate.  I can then focus on ensuring I no longer use credit, but focus on using cash and saving for my future.  In viewing my credit report and score, you'll see that I've consistently made payments over time and have even sucessfully recently paid off my auto loan - now I need to focus on the credit card debt and will do so with your assistance.  I'm embarrased to admit that with both an undergraduate degree in business and a master's degree, I've never paid attention to finances - with what is going on in the nation, I find it essential to do so and with the knowlege I'm gaining am sure I won't continue my spending habits, nor continue to increase my debt.

The owners of the home have recently divorced and are selling the home so we have to move.  My daughter wants to remain in the same school district, so I need semi-immediate access to relocation funds so I can sign a lease on new rental in the area.  In the past, I would have resorted to credit card advances for such contingencies, but last year, after the credit card companies began jacking rates on even their good customers, I angrily cancelled all of my cards, and am in the process of paying them down.  So I've decided to try Lending Club out.  I intend on paying most of this loan off with my tax returns this spring.  If it works out, I might come back after and get another loan to consolidate high interest credit card debt.  <br/><br/>I always pay my bills - I have no late payments or delinquencies on my credit report.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration!<br/>",moving,Relocation Expenses,945xx,CA,22.09,0.0,Nov-1991,1.0,,,8.0,0.0,7900.0,98.7%,31.0,f,0.0,0.0,4763.6059446104,4138.38,4000.0,763.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,Sep-2012,2141.34,,Feb-2017,0.0,1.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,N,,,,,,

I've been with this company for 2 years, and I transferred from a sister company for which I worked for 4 years - 6 years total with the organization.
